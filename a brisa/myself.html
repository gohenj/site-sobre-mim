       <p class ="poeminha">It's not true
        Tell me I’ve been lied to
        Crying isn't like you, ooh
        What the hell did I do?
        Never been the type to
        Let someone see right through, ooh</p>

       <p class ="poeminha">Maybe won't you take it back?
        Say you were tryna make me laugh
        And nothing has to change today
        You didn't mean to say: I love you
        I love you
        And I don't want to, ooh
        
        The smile that you gave me
        Even when you felt like dying
        
        We fall apart as it gets dark
        I'm in your arms in Central Park
        There's nothing you could do or say
        I can’t escape the way I love you
        I don’t want to
        But I love you, ooh
        Ooh, ooh
        Ooh, ooh</p>
